I just bought a new domain and decided it would be nice to explain the reason of the name...

On 2011 a few friends and I started a blog. We called it *Latest Build*, used the now deceased [Posterous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous) for publishing, and bought the domain *latestbuild.net*. We ended up not maintaning the site, and not renewing the domain.  I really liked the name, and it was my first option when creating this one. Unfortunatelly, it is not available anymore.

I started trying a few ones, looking for new ones, but also names similar to that one. While googling for ideas, I found [Jenkins' terminology page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Terminology). One of the terms caught my attention: *Unstable Build*. It was quite similar to the old one, but the description reflected more how I believe this blog will be maintained:

> A build is unstable if it was built successfully and one or more publishers report it unstable. For example if the JUnit publisher is configured and a test fails then the build will be marked unstable.
